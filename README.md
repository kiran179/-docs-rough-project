Project Aim:
To develop a Healthcare System Application Using IoT and NanoTechnology for Diagnostics
      
Project Mission:
Reduce Diagnostic Costs & Wait-Time's For Patients-----Reduce Number of Site Visits to Hospital/Pharmacy
      
Project Requirements: 
Will need to design/configure required HealthCare database or Cloud Platform to Capture the Live Data from IoT-NanoBots(Nano Particles Infused with Sensors)to the database system.
Will need to design/configure, IoT-Sensor Technology for Transmitting the pre-defined data attributes from the physiological body into Mobile Application.
Need To Create a Prototype of the Working Model for the Project.
    
WorkFlow Design: 
Will need to create ProtoType for Establishing/Integrating the System.
      
Technology Requirements:
NanoBots, IoT, DataBase/Cloud, Mobile Technology.

Legal Requirements:
FDA Approval, Prototype Acceptance, Other Legal Obligations.

Budget Requirements:
Needs Work- Can be Established, Once The Prototype Design is Ready.

Integration Requirements:
Pre-Requisite----->Prototype Design Completion/ WorkFlow Design.

Testing Requirements:
Will need to first test the system prototype for design/approval/working/backlogs, etc..

Release Requirements:
Pre-requisite----> After WorkFlow/Prototype Approval.
